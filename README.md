# 💧 Water Forecast Web

**Water Forecast Web** is the frontend interface built with **React**, which consumes APIs from the [water-forecast](https://github.com/ramironunes/water-forecast) backend and displays water consumption forecasts generated by AI models from the [water-forecast-ai](https://github.com/ramironunes/water-forecast-ai) project.

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static typing, [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling, and [Volta](https://volta.sh) to pin the Node.js version.
